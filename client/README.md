### Dependencies

Run `npm init` in the server folder to install dependencies related to Express.
`cd client` and run `npm init` install dependencies related to React (the client).
(have two terminals open and run `npm start` in client folder and also in the server folder when you want to render the backend and frontend).

Installed:
material-ui/core and material-ui/icons ( library used for the looking glass and for the cart icons)

react-currency-format ( used for currency formatting, not yet implemented)

react-router-dom and react-dom (routing)

npm install @headlessui/react (UI component I used when experimenting with category filter)

npm i @heroicons/react (set of React icons used for category filter)


Also started testing Firebase (similar to mySQL, run by Google. I think it can run in parallel with mySQL...something to look into further if we want)
